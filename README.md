# Mobile Flashcards

Mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and then take quizzes on those decks.
At the end of the quiz, the score will be shown.

The app was tested on iPhone 7 (Device) and iPhone XR (Emulator) using the expo app
